######################## Filebeat Configuration ############################

# This file is a full configuration example documenting all non-deprecated
# options in comments. For a shorter configuration example, that contains only
# the most common options, please see filebeat.yml in the same directory.
#
# You can find the full configuration reference here:
# https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/beats/filebeat/index.html


#==========================  Modules configuration =============================
filebeat.autodiscover:
  providers:
    - type: docker
      hints.enabled: true

#filebeat.modules:
#------------------------------- Traefik Module -------------------------------
#- module: traefik
  # Access logs
#  access:
#    enabled: true

    # Set custom paths for the log files. If left empty,
    # Filebeat will choose the paths depending on your OS.
#    var.paths: ["/var/log/traefik/access.log"]

    # Input configuration (advanced). Any input configuration option
    # can be added under this section.
    #input:


#=========================== Filebeat inputs =============================

# List of inputs to fetch data.
filebeat.inputs:
# Each - is an input. Most options can be set at the input level, so
# you can use different inputs for various configurations.
# Below are the input specific configurations.

# Type of the files. Based on this the way the file is read is decided.
# The different types cannot be mixed in one input
#
# Possible options are:
# * log: Reads every line of the log file (default)
# * stdin: Reads the standard in

#------------------------------ Log input --------------------------------

- type: log

  # Change to true to enable this input configuration.
  enabled: false

  # Paths that should be crawled and fetched. Glob based paths.
  # To fetch all ".log" files from a specific level of subdirectories
  # /var/log/*/*.log can be used.
  # For each file found under this path, a harvester is started.
  # Make sure not file is defined twice as this can lead to unexpected behaviour.
  paths:
    - /var/log/*.log


#================================ Outputs ======================================

# Configure what output to use when sending the data collected by the beat.

#-------------------------- Elasticsearch output -------------------------------
output.elasticsearch:
  # Boolean flag to enable or disable the output module.
  enabled: true

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
  # IPv6 addresses should always be defined as: https://[2001:db8::1]:9200

  #username: "elastic"
  #password: "changeme"

#============================== Dashboards =====================================
# These settings control loading the sample dashboards to the Kibana index. Loading
# the dashboards are disabled by default and can be enabled either by setting the
# options here, or by using the `-setup` CLI flag or the `setup` command.
setup.dashboards.enabled: true

# The directory from where to read the dashboards. The default is the `kibana`
# folder in the home path.
#setup.dashboards.directory: ${path.home}/kibana

# The URL from where to download the dashboards archive. It is used instead of
# the directory if it has a value.
#setup.dashboards.url:

# The file archive (zip file) from where to read the dashboards. It is used instead
# of the directory when it has a value.
#setup.dashboards.file:

# In case the archive contains the dashboards from multiple Beats, this lets you
# select which one to load. You can load all the dashboards in the archive by
# setting this to the empty string.
#setup.dashboards.beat: filebeat

# The name of the Kibana index to use for setting the configuration. Default is ".kibana"
#setup.dashboards.kibana_index: .kibana

# The Elasticsearch index name. This overwrites the index name defined in the
# dashboards and index pattern. Example: testbeat-*
#setup.dashboards.index:

# Always use the Kibana API for loading the dashboards instead of autodetecting
# how to install the dashboards by first querying Elasticsearch.
#setup.dashboards.always_kibana: false

# If true and Kibana is not reachable at the time when dashboards are loaded,
# it will retry to reconnect to Kibana instead of exiting with an error.

# By default template loading is enabled and the template is loaded.
# These settings can be adjusted to load your own template or overwrite existing ones.

# Set to false to disable template loading.
#setup.template.enabled: true

# Template name. By default the template name is "filebeat-%{[agent.version]}"
# The template name and pattern has to be set in case the Elasticsearch index pattern is modified.
#setup.template.name: "filebeat-%{[agent.version]}"

# Template pattern. By default the template pattern is "-%{[agent.version]}-*" to apply to the default index settings.
# The first part is the version of the beat and then -* is used to match all daily indices.
# The template name and pattern has to be set in case the Elasticsearch index pattern is modified.
#setup.template.pattern: "filebeat-%{[agent.version]}-*"

# Path to fields.yml file to generate the template
#setup.template.fields: "${path.config}/fields.yml"

# A list of fields to be added to the template and Kibana index pattern. Also
# specify setup.template.overwrite: true to overwrite the existing template.

#============================== Setup ILM =====================================

# Configure index lifecycle management (ILM). These settings create a write
# alias and add additional settings to the index template. When ILM is enabled,
# output.elasticsearch.index is ignored, and the write alias is used to set the
# index name.

# Enable ILM support. Valid values are true, false, and auto. When set to auto
# (the default), the Beat uses index lifecycle management when it connects to a
# cluster that supports ILM; otherwise, it creates daily indices.
setup.ilm.enabled: auto

# Set the prefix used in the index lifecycle write alias name. The default alias
# name is 'filebeat-%{[agent.version]}'.

  # The permissions mask to apply when rotating log files. The default value is 0600.
  # Must be a valid Unix-style file permissions mask expressed in octal notation.
  #permissions: 0600

  # Enable log file rotation on time intervals in addition to size-based rotation.
  # Intervals must be at least 1s. Values of 1m, 1h, 24h, 7*24h, 30*24h, and 365*24h
  # are boundary-aligned with minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years as
  # reported by the local system clock. All other intervals are calculated from the
  # Unix epoch. Defaults to disabled.

#monitoring.cluster_uuid:

# Uncomment to send the metrics to Elasticsearch. Most settings from the
# Elasticsearch output are accepted here as well.
# Note that the settings should point to your Elasticsearch *monitoring* cluster.
# Any setting that is not set is automatically inherited from the Elasticsearch
# output configuration, so if you have the Elasticsearch output configured such
# that it is pointing to your Elasticsearch monitoring cluster, you can simply
# uncomment the following line.
monitoring.elasticsearch:

  # Array of hosts to connect to.
  # Scheme and port can be left out and will be set to the default (http and 9200)
  # In case you specify and additional path, the scheme is required: http://localhost:9200/path
